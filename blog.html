            <h1>HOW LONG SHOULD A BLOG POST BE? – A THOROUGH ANALYSIS</h1>
            <p>
              Due to the highly competitive nature of the SEO landscape, knowing
              the tricks of the trade that give your content the edge up on your
              competitors is what every content marketer seeks. Determining how
              long a blog should be is essential because it can affect budgets,
              posting frequency, and overall content marketing performance.
            </p>
            <h2>How Long Should a Blog Post Be?</h2>
            <p>
              So, how long should a blog post be? The answer can be tricky,
              since there’s more at play than just a one-size-fits-all search
              engine mandate. There are a number of differing opinions from SEOs
              about what the magical word count should be for a blog post, and
              many of them are based on data gathered as long ago as 2012. Since
              the internet has changed quite a bit since then, we’ll analyze
              more current data to help answer this question. But first, let’s
              go over some of the most common charts that everyone else uses to
              answer this question.

              What do These Charts Mean When It comes to How Long a Blog Post
              Should Be?

              Both charts dramatically show that content with a higher word
              count ranks better within Google’s top 10 than content with a
              lower word count. This could be in conjunction with the number of
              shares the posts get (we’ll get to this) or could just be an
              inherent preference by Search Engines like Google to favor longer
              articles with a higher word count. Another theory is that topical
              relevancy is increased with longer word count, by nature of the
              inclusion of more details and related keywords in the content.
              Google then gets a deeper understanding of your content’s overall
              topic, thus boosting your position. Lastly, there’s also the idea
              that the site owners that are publishing the longer content pieces
              that are ranking well just care more about providing excellent,
              in-depth content. While this scenario is likely true for a lot of
              site-owners, it’s impossible to narrow it down to one specific
              thing using an average across millions of blogs. So how long
              should a blog be? According to these graphs – and many SEO’s have
              concluded their numbers based on these graphs – the right word
              count for how long a blog should be is an average of 2,225 words.

            <h3>How Are These SEO Blog Length Charts Misleading?</h3>
            <p>
              The main reason these are misleading is due to the deliberate
              setting of the scale of the Y-Axis. The Y-Axis scale is a very
              small subset of the total 2,450 words, basically only showing us a
              sliver of it with a span of 300-400 words. This small scale makes
              the word count jumps look huge between ranking position 1 and 10.
              Based on the charts, many make the false assumption that if you
              don’t write blog posts that are at least 2,225 words, you won’t
              rank high at all. This is simply not true.

              Both charts dramatically show that content with a higher word
              count ranks better within Google’s top 10 than content with a
              lower word count. This could be in conjunction with the number of
              shares the posts get (we’ll get to this) or could just be an
              inherent preference by Search Engines like Google to favor longer
              articles with a higher word count. Another theory is that topical
              relevancy is increased with longer word count, by nature of the
              inclusion of more details and related keywords in the content.
              Google then gets a deeper understanding of your content’s overall
              topic, thus boosting your position. Lastly, there’s also the idea
              that the site owners that are publishing the longer content pieces
              that are ranking well just care more about providing excellent,
              in-depth content. While this scenario is likely true for a lot of
              site-owners, it’s impossible to narrow it down to one specific
              thing using an average across millions of blogs. So how long
              should a blog be? According to these graphs – and many SEO’s have
              concluded their numbers based on these graphs – the right word
              count for how long a blog should be is an average of 2,225 words.

            <h3>How Are These SEO Blog Length Charts Misleading?</h3>
            <p>
              The main reason these are misleading is due to the deliberate
              setting of the scale of the Y-Axis. The Y-Axis scale is a very
              small subset of the total 2,450 words, basically only showing us a
              sliver of it with a span of 300-400 words. This small scale makes
              the word count jumps look huge between ranking position 1 and 10.
              Based on the charts, many make the false assumption that if you
              don’t write blog posts that are at least 2,225 words, you won’t
              rank high at all. This is simply not true.

              Matt Bentley from CanIRank shows us the true effect longer-form
              content has on rankings. First, Matt took the same data, which
              mimicked the charts above, but set the scale from 0 to 2,500 words
              for a blog post on the Y-axis. He also extended the X-axis to show
              Google rankings from 1 to 40. Here’s how it looks:
